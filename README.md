### Hi there 👋


**nvoevodin/nvoevodin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on documenting a bunch of my existing projects. Some of them are huge and scattered across multiple locations. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DuckDB for local big data warehousing
- 💬 Ask me about R, Python, React, React-Native Expo, SQL, and peripheral infrastructural solutions for hosting and backend.
- 📫 How to reach me: voevodin.nv@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Wrote a book - you can get familiar with my thought process by checking it out (nikitavoevodin.com)
